NCIDENT REPORT
Issue Summary:
Duration: June 10, 2023, 3:00 PM to June 10, 2023, 6:30 PM (EAT)
Impact: The search functionality of the web application was unavailable for all users during the incident, resulting in a complete loss of search functionality. Approximately 80% of the user base was affected, leading to frustration and hindered user experience.

Timeline:
- Issue Detected: June 10, 2023, 3:00 PM (EAT), when monitoring alerts indicated a spike in error rates and a sudden drop in search-related API calls.
- Actions Taken: The engineering team immediately investigated the issue by analyzing server logs and checking the search service infrastructure. Initially, the assumption was that the search service itself was experiencing performance degradation.
- Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths: The team spent significant time examining the search service components, including the search algorithm, indexing mechanism, and database connections. However, these investigations did not reveal any abnormalities in the search service itself.
- Incident Escalation: As the investigation progressed without finding a conclusive root cause, the incident was escalated to the senior development team and the infrastructure team for additional assistance and expertise.
- Incident Resolution: After careful analysis, it was discovered that the issue originated from a misconfiguration in the load balancer that distributes traffic to the search service. The load balancer was intermittently failing to route requests to the search servers, causing the search functionality to be unavailable. The misconfiguration was promptly corrected, restoring full search functionality.

Root Cause and Resolution:
- Root Cause: The misconfiguration of the load balancer caused intermittent failures in routing requests to the search servers. This resulted in a complete loss of search functionality for users.
- Resolution: The misconfiguration was identified and rectified by adjusting the load balancer settings to ensure proper routing of search requests. Additionally, thorough testing was conducted to verify the resolution and ensure the stability of the search functionality.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Improvement/Fixes: 
  1. Enhance load balancer configuration management processes to prevent misconfigurations.
  2. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for load balancer health and performance.
  3. Conduct regular load testing to identify potential issues before they impact production.
- Task List:
  1. Update load balancer configuration documentation to include best practices and guidelines.
  2. Conduct a thorough review of other critical infrastructure components to identify any similar misconfigurations.
  3. Enhance incident response procedures to include load balancer-specific troubleshooting steps.
  4. Schedule recurring load balancer audits to ensure ongoing adherence to configuration best practices.

By implementing these measures, we aim to minimize the occurrence of similar incidents in the future, improve system reliability, and maintain a seamless user experience.
